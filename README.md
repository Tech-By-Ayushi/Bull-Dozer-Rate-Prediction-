**Predicting the future sale price of heavy equipment with ML & scikit-learn**

---


## üß† Overview

Welcome to the **Bluebook for Bulldozers** machine learning project!
This notebook demonstrates how to build a predictive model that estimates the **sale price of used bulldozers** using historical auction data.

> **Problem Statement**:
> *Can we accurately predict the future sale price of a bulldozer based on its features and historical sales data?*

## üì¶ Dataset

The data comes from the [Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers).
It includes various features about bulldozers such as sale date, model, usage hours, manufacturer, and more.

## üìä Model Performance

We trained a `RandomForestRegressor` on a subset of the data (`max_samples=10,000`) and achieved the following results:

| Metric       | Training | Validation |
| ------------ | -------- | ---------- |
| **MAE**      | 5,561.30 | 7,177.26   |
| **RMSLE**    | 0.2577   | 0.2936     |
| **R¬≤ Score** | 0.8607   | 0.8320     |

> ‚úÖ **Conclusion**: The model generalizes well with limited overfitting. Further improvement is possible with tuning and feature engineering.

## üîß Hyperparameter Tuning

We used **RandomizedSearchCV** to explore the hyperparameter space efficiently:

```python
params = {
  'n_estimators': [100, 200, 500],
  'max_depth': [None, 10, 30],
  'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],
  'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4],
  'max_features': ['auto', 'sqrt']
}
```

This helped optimize model performance while keeping training times reasonable.
